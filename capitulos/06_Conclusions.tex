Working on this project helped me to visualize many of the difficulties that developers and researchers encounter when facing the challenge of smart cities and the standardization of data, even if it is open data for public access. The fact of gathering data from such heterogeneous sources and systems generates the need to provide a context and a series of standard formats to this information so that automatic systems can process it. We have seen how FIWARE and the entire community formed around it is working to advance in this field and achieving very promising results.

On a personal level, I have also enjoyed the challenge of designing and managing a cluster with Kubernetes, and this project has also served to strengthen my knowledge of the technology and further reinforce my idea of working with similar systems in the future. It has also helped me to get to work with a real deployment of Machine Learning, and face similar problems that many people are facing right now with the boom of a technology as exciting as Artificial Intelligence.

In short, I think it has been a very transversal and complete project, where many of the technologies that have recently arrived to stay in our society, although they are invisible to the general public, have been addressed, and meanwhile, the problem of integrating them and creating a complete system has really helped me to understand their advantages and problems way better.
