\label{chapter:Motivation}

With this project, our goal is to develop a scalable and microservices-based cloud system that will help us to create a complete platform oriented to smart cities. With this, we will be able to collaborate in the deployment and implementation of smart systems, focused on the cities in our area.

We will also collaborate with FIWARE on the adaptation of the platform to cloud environments such as Kubernetes and Spark, and in the future, it will be easily portable to any cloud service provider. With this, we will prove that scalable and modular deployments on the cloud can be achieved using FIWARE components and its Generic Enables, as well as other Open Source tools.

Collaterally, we will also help to make more useful and promote the use and publication of open data by public administrations and municipalities, and ultimately, we will try to improve the technological services offered to citizens, making available tools powered by the use of Machine Learning and the cloud.
